# DEAD END

## Description

DEAD END is an enthralling immersive experience that puts the user into the story. It takes input from the user and really makes them feel like their choices are effecting the outcome with realism. The goal with DEAD END was always and forever will be fun for the people. We use the ideals that if we are not having fun writing and coding the story then how could the user have fun playing? So everyday of work is a day of fun for us here at DEAD END!

## Usage

First and foremost! go to the website https://visualnovel.onrender.com/ once you are there you will be greated by a skull(don't worry he is friendly) and the title of the game. In the center of the screen you will see a start button you can click that to start the game. But Beware! if you are not signed in your progress will not be saved! So i would highly reccomend you click the little login button in the upper left. Once there you can sign in on the left side of the screen. DO NOT PANIC if you do not have an account simply look a couple inches to the right and you can make one. Once you have either signed in you will be taken back to the homepage with the skull.(he is a little less friendly now but still pretty friendly.) Now you make click start game and begin the experience, enjoy.
