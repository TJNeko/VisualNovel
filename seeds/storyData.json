    "story": "As you head through the path and wind through the trees you hear distant footsteps. They slowly get closer and closer to you as you continue to walk. Suddenly you hear heavy breathing breathing behind you, you turn around to see a wolf snarling at you, before you can move it bites your left leg and tears into it tearing the meat from the bone. You fall to the ground screaming in pain, but no one hears you. You try to crawl away but what is left of your leg crumples under the pressure of your own weight. You lay there as the wolf approaches knowing this is your end."
